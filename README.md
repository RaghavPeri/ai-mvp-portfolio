# 🚀 AI MVP Portfolio – Raghav Peri

Welcome to my personal AI Product Management portfolio. This repo contains multiple working AI MVPs that solve real-world problems using machine learning, NLP, embeddings, and generative AI workflows.

Each MVP was built hands-on using tools like Google Colab, OpenAI, Google Apps Script, Python, and Streamlit — with product thinking baked in.

Use cases span personalization, classification, segmentation, predictive analytics, **recommendation systems**, **model fairness**, **explainability**, and resume/job matching — all aligned to real stakeholder needs across industries like retail, finance, legal, and healthcare.
