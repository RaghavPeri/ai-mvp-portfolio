# 🧠 AI MVP Portfolio – Raghav Peri

Welcome to my personal AI Product Management portfolio. This repo contains multiple working AI MVPs that solve real-world problems using machine learning, NLP, embeddings, and generative AI workflows.

Each MVP was built hands-on using tools like Google Colab, OpenAI, Google Apps Script, Python, and Streamlit — with product thinking baked in. Use cases span personalization, classification, predictive analytics, and resume/job matching.
