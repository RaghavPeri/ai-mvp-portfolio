# 🧠 Enterprise GenAI Suite – Campaign Automation MVPs  
_Built by Raghav Peri_

This suite contains **four enterprise-grade AI MVPs** developed to automate product content generation across image, text, code, and tone management. Originally designed for a real-world Product Manager role at Williams-Sonoma, these builds generalize across any retail, home, or lifestyle brand operating at scale.

Each MVP solves a real business challenge with hands-on execution — using LangChain, OpenAI, Replit agents, Streamlit, and agentic orchestration.
