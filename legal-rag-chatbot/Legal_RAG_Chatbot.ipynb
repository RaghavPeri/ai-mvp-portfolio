The tenant must first notify the landlord of the situation and allow a reasonable amount of time for the landlord to make repairs or replacements. If the landlord fails to take action, the tenant may have the repairs made and deduct the cost from future rent. However, the tenant may still be taken to court for nonpayment of rent.\n"
